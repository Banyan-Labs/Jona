About us
Office Hours is an online platform that lets users earn income by sharing what they know. Users create knowledge profiles to accept hourly consultation requests or survey opportunities based on their professional expertise. Companies and organizations seeking unique insights can search the Office Hours marketplace to quickly find and learn from thousands of advisors on demand.
What we believe
We believe that human knowledge is the world’s most valuable asset. And yet, despite being more interconnected than ever, most knowledge still remains stuck in our heads, inaccessible and underutilized. Office Hours’ mission is to help everyone realize the value of what they know by building tools for the knowledge-sharing economy.
Our team is headquartered in San Francisco and backed by top marketplace and business operators like Saar Gur, Marco Zappacosta, Lenny Rachitsky, Jackson Gates, and Aaron Levie.

Summary
Similar to Uber or Airbnb, things are simple on the surface: search, match, connect, and pay. But under the hood, there are endless fun and challenging engineering problems across search, discovery, recommendations, data, logistics, payments, and performance. We’ve built the entire stack from the ground up: profiles to showcase what people know, search experiences to find and discover relevant matches, workflow tools and integrations to help streamline logistics (e.g., compliance, scheduling, payments, etc), & even an underlying knowledge graph that helps stitch all of these experiences together.
We’re specifically looking for an experienced backend engineer. They’re likely a generalist with a lean towards data platform or data engineering experience. As our companys growth has accelerated, so have our data opportunities and challenges. How might we improve the precision, recall, and performance of our search and recommendation experience? How might we design internal services to best leverage our knowledge graph across the platform? How might we best architect clean, extensible, and composable APIs to accelerate development velocity?
Our ideal candidate is excited about building systems for data collection, processing, storage, and retrieval and is passionate about making these systems observable, reliable, scalable, and highly automated.
Responsibilities
Build the backend for various user-facing features
Improve the platform architecture and data model to provide a performant, reliable product experience
Continuously improve engineering processes, tools, and systems that allow us to scale the code base, productivity, and team
Enhance our analytics, monitoring, and alerts so that we can identify and respond to operational incidents
Qualifications
You have 6+ years of software engineering experience
You take pride in your craft and have a track record of shipping high-quality products and features at scale
You have the ability to turn user and business problems into engineering solutions
You’re a self-starter who embraces ambiguity, a fast-paced environment, and solving hard problems
Workflow: GitHub, Slack, Notion, Figma, Amplitude, Storybook
Front end (not required for this role): React, Next.js, Tailwind
Competitive salary & stock options
Healthcare, dental, and vision coverage
Gym/wellness benefits
Flexible vacation time, regular company holidays
Company retreats (Tahoe, Maui, Mendocino, Mexico City)
Parent-friendly, remote work, and paid family leave
Join our team and help everyone realize the true power of what they know!
Pay Transparency Notice
Full-time offers from Office Hours also include target equity + benefits (including medical, dental, vision, and 401(k)).
Pay range: $160,000-$210,000 based on seniority and relevant experience
San Francisco-based preferred (2-3 days per week in office). Open to NYC office-based or fully remote for the right candidate.
Don’t meet every single requirement? Studies have shown that some candidates, especially underrepresented groups such as women and people of color, are less likely to apply to jobs unless they meet every single qualification. At Office Hours, we believe in building a diverse and inclusive workplace, so if you’re excited about this role but don’t meet every qualification in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. You could still be the right candidate for this or other roles at Office Hours!

Huron helps its clients drive growth, enhance performance and sustain leadership in the markets they serve. We help healthcare organizations build innovation capabilities and accelerate key growth initiatives, enabling organizations to own the future, instead of being disrupted by it. Together, we empower clients to create sustainable growth, optimize internal processes and deliver better consumer outcomes.

Health systems, hospitals and medical clinics are under immense pressure to improve clinical outcomes and reduce the cost of providing patient care. Investing in new partnerships, clinical services and technology is not enough to create meaningful and substantive change. To succeed long-term, healthcare organizations must empower leaders, clinicians, employees, affiliates and communities to build cultures that foster innovation to achieve the best outcomes for patients.

Joining the Huron team means you’ll help our clients evolve and adapt to the rapidly changing healthcare environment and optimize existing business operations, improve clinical outcomes, create a more consumer-centric healthcare experience, and drive physician, patient and employee engagement across the enterprise.

Join our team as the expert you are now and create your future.

We’re seeking a top-performing, hands-on Senior Lead Software Engineer to join our Clinical Insights team and lead the development of rapidly deployable healthcare analytics products. This is an opportunity for a technical athlete who thrives in fast-paced environments and enjoys working directly with customers to shape the future of healthcare delivery.

You’ll be at the forefront of innovation, developing end-to-end solutions that drive insight and impact using tools like Shiny, Streamlit, Quarto, and R Markdown. You’ll collaborate with a high-caliber, cross-functional team of PhDs, engineers, product managers, and consultants to create intuitive, scalable analytics tools that are delivered into production at speed.

We’re looking for someone who can both architect robust data pipelines and bring results to life through interactive and insightful visual applications.

Role Summary

In this role, you will:

Lead the rapid development and deployment of healthcare analytics products and decision-support tools.
Design and manage ETL pipelines, leveraging both traditional (e.g., MySQL) and modern platforms (e.g., Snowflake, Databricks) to transform clinical and operational data into actionable insights.
Build and deploy interactive applications using R and Python with Shiny, Streamlit, Quarto, and R Markdown (Rmd)
Collaborate directly with healthcare clients, iterating on analytics products based on feedback and measurable outcomes.
Implement and tune statistical and machine learning models to power diagnostics, forecasts, and simulations.
Mentor junior developers and help drive best practices across a small, elite team.

Key Responsibilities

Build and deploy production-grade analytics products that support healthcare decision-makers.
Translate product requirements into technical architecture and fast prototypes.
Maintain and optimize end-to-end data pipelines, ETL processes, and model deployment workflows.
Drive quality, performance, and speed in analytics delivery across multiple clients.
Engage with product leadership and customers to deeply understand problems, present solutions, and adapt based on feedback.

Required Qualifications

U.S. work authorization is required.
Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Data Science, Engineering, or related field (or equivalent experience).
7+ years of software development experience, including leading teams or projects.
Proven expertise developing analytics products in healthcare settings (required).
Strong proficiency in Python and/or R (required)
Strong knowledge of relational databases (MySQL preferred); experience designing and maintaining data pipelines.
Self-starter comfortable with ambiguity and fast-paced iteration.
Excellent collaboration skills and customer-facing communication.

Preferred Qualifications

Experience building solutions in Shiny, Streamlit, Quarto, and Rmd (preferred).
Experience using Posit Connect or similar tools for deploying analytics products.
Experience with Snowflake, Databricks, or other modern cloud-based data platforms.
Agile/Scrum development process familiarity.
Working knowledge of AWS, Linux, and enterprise-scale data architectures.
Experience optimizing data workflows and applications for real-world client environments.
