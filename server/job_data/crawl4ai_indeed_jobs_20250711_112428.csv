And we've been able to refinance $6+ Billion in loans through our network of Splash, powered credit union and bank partners who leverage our marketplace and automated loan processing technology. And we've raised over $70 million from investors like partners of DST Global, Citi Ventures, TruStage Ventures, Northwestern Mutual Future Ventures, Detroit Venture Partners, and more.

At Splash, everything we do is guided by our values:
Own It – We take full accountability and follow through on commitments.
Raise the Bar – We move fast, innovate faster, and push through barriers.

Elevate Each Other – We win as a team by lifting each other up.

From small family-owned shops to publicly traded enterprises, AIQ serves businesses of all sizes, delivering scalable solutions that eliminate guesswork and empower smarter decision-making.

Born in the fast-moving world of legal cannabis, we’re no strangers to complex regulation and messy data. That’s where we thrive. Our roots in regulation make us creative, adaptable, and relentless in solving hard problems.

We’re a fully remote, internet-native team—scrappy, curious, and obsessed with building tools that work. If that sounds like your kind of environment, you’ll fit right in.

Frontend Engineer (React + React Native + Typescript)
Full-time | Remote-friendly
We’re looking for a frontend engineer who’s strong in React + TypeScript and has experience building mobile apps with React Native (Expo preferred!). You’ll be working on our internal dashboard product (AIQ), turning clean designs into slick, usable interfaces for both web and mobile.

We're looking for a senior front-end engineer and product thinker to help us bring Kolab (https://www.getkolab.ai) to life.
Kolab is a new kind of digital facilitation platform that combines video, canvas, spatial audio, and collaboration templates into a single experience. It's a bit like if Miro, Zoom, Butter, and Discord had a baby—but with a strong emphasis on human-centered design and cohort-based learning. Our product is heavily front-end, visual, and experiential. We're building for facilitators, not just meeting hosts.
Our small but experienced team has built a working v1. We've run real-world demos and pilots, and user feedback is extremely positive. We're now entering a 6-month sprint to sharpen onboarding, polish UI/UX, and convert interest into paying customers.
Role
We're seeking a contractor who can contribute 10–20 hours/week to help us:
Polish and extend our front-end feature set
Improve and refactor existing UI flows (onboarding, templates, agenda builder)
Collaborate on product decisions, not just execute tickets
Bring strong design sensibilities to small details and larger flows
Translate creative facilitation ideas into intuitive UI components

You'll be working closely with our founding team (CTO + CEO + occasional support engineers). Our stack is largely built in Node.js, React, and LiveKit (for video). Familiarity with spatial design, collaboration tools, or edtech is a plus, but not required.
About You
You have strong experience in React and modern JS/TS workflows
You feel comfortable working across a full stack JS environment with Postgres backing
You have excellent design intuition—you can look at a feature and see what feels off
You care about visual polish, UX detail, and user flow coherence
You love building things that make people say ""whoa, this is different""
You're comfortable working async with a lean team, jumping on occasional calls to align
Logistics
Start: July 2025
Time: 10–20 hours/week
Pay: $65–$70/hour depending on experience
Duration: 3–6 months, with possibility of extension
Location: Remote, US timezone overlap preferred but not required

This role oversees a small family of teams and provides technical, product, and team level leadership to those teams, and this person will be hands-on in the code while also having the opportunity to grow successful direct reports, and run productive teams.
About the team
Omnichannel Product Group's mission is to empower front-office teams to accelerate deal closures, proactively resolve customer issues, and personalize interactions through an AI-first omnichannel platform. We simplify complexity by seamlessly integrating communication channels into core workflows, enabling teams to focus on their core use cases and improving rep productivity.
This role is ideal for a technical leader who thrives at the intersection of infrastructure, API integration, and business impact — and who can scale a voice platform to support thousands of reps and millions of conversations reliably.
In this role you will:
Lead a team of backend and infrastructure engineers focused on building reliable, scalable, and high-quality voice platform capabilities, real-time communication, and integration with Sales and Service workflows.
Foster an inclusive environment within small cross-functional teams of engineers, product managers, designers, and analysts.
Collaborate and build trusted relationships with HubSpotters all over the company, whether in engineering, product, design, research, marketing, or sales.
Deliver value iteratively by envisioning, experimenting, building, and monitoring the performance of new features and tools that contribute to HubSpots growth.
Get direct exposure to how HubSpot works as a business!
You may be a fit if:
Have hands-on experience building or managing voice communication platforms, preferably using Twilio Programmable Voice, Voice Insights, and Media Streams.
Have led teams that build and operate distributed systems with real-time and high-availability constraints.
Understand telecom fundamentals (SIP, PSTN, codecs, latency, jitter) and how to abstract them away for product teams.
Experience working with Go To Market teams, internal product teams, business process automation, and/or customized CRM implementations.
You demonstrate a strong user focus with the ability to understand user needs and empathize with the challenges they face.
You not only get excited about big technical challenges, but being close to our business and go-to-market strategies.
You have experience mentoring/coaching technical team leads.
Key Expectations for Engineering Leads:
Engineering Leads are actively involved as a player-coach in building software and making products to solve customer problems. They are curious and involved in the technology as well as the people on their teams.
They focus on hands-on coding.
They have a strong technical vision for how to implement the product vision. This can include working with teams they oversee and external teams to ensure that we are solving problems the best way for internal customers.
They think about and implement ideas to push teams to improve technically.
They work effectively across the engineering and product organization to cultivate a strong product vision for their teams, and are responsible for the mission, direction, and alignment.
They are responsible for the engineers on their team and provide mentoring, coaching, and feedback to help them grow and succeed in their role.
They create and foster diverse teams and an inclusive culture.

Solid understanding of the current landscape of auto-scaling cloud technologies and efficient usage of compute, storage, network and virtualization technologies. (preferably AWS).
You can clearly articulate the business benefits that result from technical decisions.
