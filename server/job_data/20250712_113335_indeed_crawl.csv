Senior Frontend Engineer - React (Full Stack Friendly),Splash Financial,"Remote in Cleveland, OH","remote in cleveland, oh",2025-07-12,Indeed,"ABOUT OUR COMPANY:
The crushing weight of debt is something that we believe holds people back from reaching their dreams and making a splash in the world. So in 2013, after seeing our friends and family struggle with student loans, we created Splash Financial.
Over the years, our mission has expanded to include helping people with other forms of debt - such as refinancing credit cards, which are at all time highs in the US. And we've been able to refinance $6+ Billion in loans through our network of Splash, powered credit union and bank partners who leverage our marketplace and automated loan processing technology. And we've raised over $70 million from investors like partners of DST Global, Citi Ventures, TruStage Ventures, Northwestern Mutual Future Ventures, Detroit Venture Partners, and more.
But at our core, we're still that little company from Cleveland with a big dream: to make people more powerful than their debt and we're just getting started..
ABOUT OUR WORKPLACE:
Splash is remote-first, and proud of it.
We spend our days simplifying financial products and getting them into the hands of people who need them most. Right now, we're focused on building financial technologies that fundamentally transform how the industry lends.
Although Splash has been around since 2013, we still operate like a startup — fast-paced, nimble, and full of heart. We're good people who care deeply about doing meaningful work and we approach challenges with creativity, passion, and urgency.
And to hire the best, we provide the best: great health insurance, competitive salaries, and unique benefits like quarterly meet-ups and access to engagement tools that keep us connected — even from afar.
At Splash, everything we do is guided by our values:
Own It – We take full accountability and follow through on commitments.
Raise the Bar – We move fast, innovate faster, and push through barriers.
Say the Hard Thing – We speak up with honesty, respect, and a desire to solve problems and make things better.
Elevate Each Other – We win as a team by lifting each other up.
These values show up in how we work and how we connect — whether we're collaborating on big projects or bonding over everyday moments. Yes, we even have Slack channels for #kids-and-pets and #food because we believe being human makes us better teammates.

This candidate also must have a constructive spirit and collaborate well with others. We value directness and candor at Splash, and we want you to speak your mind and make a big impact, but don't tolerate unconstructive negativity… we are solution builders here and culture is critical!
